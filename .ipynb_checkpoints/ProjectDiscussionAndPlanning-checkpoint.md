We will meet 45 min a week likely on the weekend. If you can't make the meeting, keep texting your updates thoroughly. 
Each member will have a clearly defined responibility within the project.
Each member will text their updates regularly, probably every couple of days.
The goal is to make some simulation of the 3 body problem. This is a very complex problem with no general solution so the solution will be a purely numerical simulation.
We will use a variety of programming paradigms because the simulation is very involved and contains many moving (literally) parts. 

1. Create a 2-body problem
2. Create a 3-body problem
3. Analyze the results and investigate the chaos. 
The goal is to simulate.
